		<h1>About Possum64</h1>
		<br>
		<h3>Overview</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Possum64 is an organization that intends to create a suite of Possum themed mobile friendly Linux applications primarily targetted at mobile Linux devices, such as the Pinephone.</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Why Possums?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Why not possums?</p>
		<br>
		<h3>Why Linux mobile?</h3>
		<br>
		<p>Linux mobile is a platform that needs more applications. Linux mobile is just starting to become viable after the releas of the Pinephone,and is shwing some serious promise as a more privacy focused and secure alternative to android or ios. it's also a way more flexible platform hte ony major roadblock for mass adoption of Mobile linux platforms is the lack of applications and unstable nature of current mobile linux environments. Possum64 aims to help fill the niche of Linux mobile app development and add some more possums in while we're at it!</p>
